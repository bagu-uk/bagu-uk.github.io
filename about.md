Do you wish you could cycle your journey but not confident of your skill on the road  or perhaps you’ve never learnt to ride and think its too late?

Do you join a traffic queue to do just five miles and see a passing cyclist getting there sooner? 

Perhaps you would like to do the school run by bike but not sure of your ability to keep them safe?

National Standard cycle training, now known as ‘Bikeability’, was introduced by the Government to raise to a high uniform standard the teaching of cycling skills for everyone – it replaced the old cycling proficiency scheme for children as outdated and inadequate for today’s roads

We offer personalised road skills cycling tuition for all ages and abilities to National Standard in and around Southampton and Dorset.
